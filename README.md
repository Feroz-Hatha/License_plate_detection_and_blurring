# License Plate Detection and Blurring

In this project, we'll attempt to use OpenCV's built-in Haar Cascades to blur license plates detected in an image!

OpenCV comes with a Russian license plate detector .xml file that we can use to detect Russian license plates within images. Once we detect a license plate, we apply OpenCV's blurring technique to blur the detected license plate ROI.
